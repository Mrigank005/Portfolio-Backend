### PROJECT_1_DEEP_DIVE: DASES (Flagship Project)
**Full Name:** Descriptive Answer Sheet Evaluation System
**Type:** Group Project (Teammates: Konal Puri, Aviral Khanna).
**Mrigank's Role:** Built the **Mobile App** from scratch (React Native/Expo) and contributed to Web Frontend.
**Status:** Mobile App is in final stages; Web App deployed at `dases.esun.solutions`.
**Summary:** An AI-driven system using OCR and LLMs to grade handwritten descriptive answers 90x faster than manual methods with 98% accuracy.
**Key Technical Features (Mobile App):**
- **Locked Exam Mode:** Implemented a "High Security" environment. Uses `AppState` listeners to detect background switching. If a student leaves the app for >15s, the exam auto-submits.
- **Secure Scanning:** Custom camera interface (VisionKit/LMS) that disables gallery uploads, forcing live capture to prevent cheating.
- **Auth Persistence:** Built a custom `SecureStoreAdapter` to bridge Supabase Auth with the device's encrypted Keychain/Keystore, solving standard localStorage security risks on mobile.
**Impact:** Reduced grading cost from ₹25/sheet (Cloud) to ₹2/sheet (In-house GPU).

### PROJECT_2_DEEP_DIVE: LexiBot (AI Legal Assistant)
**Type:** Solo Project (Patent Filed).
**Deployed Link:** `lexibot-ai.vercel.app`
**Summary:** A Telegram chatbot for Indian legal queries (Consumer, Traffic, Harassment law) using RAG.
**Technical "Flex":**
- **Intelligent Chunking:** Does NOT use fixed-size chunks. Uses an LLM + Regex pipeline to split documents at logical semantic boundaries (e.g., "Article 21", "Section 4"), preserving legal context.
- **Infrastructure:** Fully dockerized. Uses a `healthcheck` in Docker Compose to ensure the Qdrant Vector DB is fully ready before the bot application starts.
- **Memory:** Uses `ConversationBufferWindowMemory` (k=5) to handle follow-up questions ("What is the penalty for *that*?").
- **Safety:** Prevents hallucinations by strictly grounding answers in retrieved context.

### PROJECT_3_DEEP_DIVE: MealMatch AI
**Type:** Solo Project (Patent Filed).
**Deployed Link:** `mealmatch-ai.vercel.app`
**Summary:** Serverless food ordering app that generates meal combos strictly fitting *both* Budget & Calorie limits.
**Commercial Potential:** Mrigank believes this has the highest commercial potential due to mass consumer appeal.
**Technical "Flex":**
- **Algorithm:** Uses a "Knapsack-style" optimization algorithm with **Heuristic Pruning**. It pre-sorts items by "efficiency" (calories/price) and stops recursion after finding the top 6 combos to prevent UI freezes (solving the O(n³) complexity issue).
- **Compatibility Matrix:** Implemented a rule-based system to prevent culinary clashes (e.g., ensuring it doesn't suggest Rice + Pasta in the same combo).
- **Architecture:** Client-side only (Serverless). Logic runs entirely in the browser.

### PROJECT_4_DEEP_DIVE: JobFit (Resume Analyzer)
**Type:** Solo Project.
**Deployed Link:** `jobfit-analysis-ai.vercel.app`
**Summary:** An agentic AI pipeline that screens resumes against job descriptions.
**Technical "Flex":**
- **Architecture:** Uses **LangGraph** to model the analysis as a State Machine (Extraction -> Job Analysis -> Profiling -> Compatibility Scoring).
- **Security:** Implements "Direct-to-S3" uploads using AWS Presigned URLs with 5-minute expiry to bypass server bottlenecks and ensure security.
- **Handling Hallucinations:** Uses Regex-based JSON extraction (`safe_parse_json`) to clean LLM outputs before rendering.

### PROJECT_5_DEEP_DIVE: F&B Process Anomaly Detection
**Type:** Solo Project (Industrial ML).
**Repo:** `github.com/Mrigank005/F-B-Process-Anomaly-Detection-System`
**Summary:** Industrial ML pipeline to detect defects in food batches (analyzing 1500+ batches across 11 parameters).
**Technical "Flex":**
- **Ensemble Model:** Combines 4 algorithms (Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, Local Outlier Factor, Autoencoder). A batch is flagged only if ≥2 models agree (Consensus Voting).
- **Explainability:** Integrated **SHAP** (Shapley Additive Explanations) to tell operators exactly *which* sensor (e.g., "Humidity") caused the alarm.
- **Auto-Thresholding:** The Autoencoder dynamically sets its error threshold based on the 95th percentile of reconstruction error.

### PROJECT_6_DEEP_DIVE: UPES Career Services Platform
**Type:** Group Project (Teammates: Konal Puri, Aviral Khanna).
**Mrigank's Role:** Built the Frontend (React/Vite) and designed AI Prompts.
**Deployed Link:** `upes-samarth-internship.vercel.app`
**Technical Details:**
- **Attendance:** Interfaces with `navigator.mediaDevices` to capture live camera frames for attendance verification.
- **AI Assessments:** Uses "Few-Shot Chain-of-Thought" prompts to synthesize a student's daily reports into tailored interview questions.
- **UX:** Implemented "Mock" async behavior (simulated latency) to polish loading states before backend integration.

### PROJECT_7_DEEP_DIVE: Better LinkedIn
**Type:** Solo Project.
**Deployed Link:** `better-linked-in.vercel.app`
**Technical "Flex":**
- **Performance:** Uses `react-window` for list virtualization (rendering only visible posts) to handle infinite feeds without lag.
- **Custom Hooks:** Built `useStickySidebar` to mathematically calculate sticky positioning when CSS `position: sticky` fails in complex layouts.

### LEADERSHIP_AND_SOFT_SKILLS
**Leadership:**
- **Role:** Joint Events Head at UPES ACM-W Student Chapter.
- **Impact:** Organized 10+ events. Co-Convener for "Prodigy'25" Tech Fest, managing 1400+ participants and introducing 500+ freshers to tech.
- **Philosophy:** "Everyone wants to be heard and feel like they are contributing to a goal."
- **Conflict Resolution:** Approaches disagreements by presenting a logical case with supporting reasons.

**Internship Experience:**
- **Shramik Bharti NGO:** Maintained website and internal tools. Gained appreciation for grassroots social impact.

**Why 7.8 CGPA?**
- Mrigank prioritized hands-on innovation (building 7+ projects, filing 3 patents) over rote academic memorization.
