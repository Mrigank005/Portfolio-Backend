### PROJECT_1: DASES (Descriptive Answer Sheet Evaluation System)
**Type:** Group Project (Teammates: Konal Puri, Aviral Khanna - Seniors who mentored Mrigank).
**Mrigank's Specific Contribution:**
- Developed the **DASES Mobile App** from scratch using React Native & Expo.
- Contributed to the WebApp Frontend.
- Assisted in compiling training datasets for the AI models.
**Project Summary:** An AI-driven system using OCR and LLMs to grade handwritten descriptive answers 90x faster than manual methods with 98% accuracy.
**Mobile App Technical Details (Built by Mrigank):**
- **Locked Exam Mode:** Implements a "High Security" environment. Uses `AppState` listeners to detect if a student switches apps. Violations (>15s background time) auto-submit the exam.
- **Secure Scanning:** Custom camera interface (VisionKit/LMS) that disables gallery uploads, forcing live capture of answer sheets.
- **Auth:** Custom `SecureStoreAdapter` to bridge Supabase Auth with the device's encrypted Keychain/Keystore.
**System Impact:**
- Reduced grading cost from ₹25/sheet (Cloud) to ₹2/sheet (In-house GPU).
- Processed 400+ sheets with 95% rubric accuracy.

### PROJECT_2: UPES Career Services Platform
**Type:** Group Project (Teammates: Konal Puri, Aviral Khanna).
**Mrigank's Specific Contribution:**
- Developed the **Frontend (WebApp)** using React, Vite, and Tailwind.
- Designed the **AI System Prompts** (Llama-2/3) for interview question generation.
- (Note: Backend architecture and core logic were led by Konal & Aviral).
**Project Summary:** An internship management platform handling Daily Reflective Reports (DRR), attendance, and standardized assessments.
**Technical Details:**
- **Attendance:** Interfaces with `navigator.mediaDevices` to capture live camera frames for attendance verification.
- **AI Assessments:** Uses "Few-Shot Chain-of-Thought" prompts to synthesize a student's daily reports into tailored interview questions.
- **UX:** Implemented "Mock" async behavior (simulated latency) to polish the loading states and UI feedback loops before backend integration.

### PROJECT_3: MealMatch AI
**Type:** Solo Project.
**Status:** Patent Applied.
**Summary:** Serverless food ordering app that generates meal combos (Main + Drink + Dessert) strictly fitting specific Budget & Calorie limits.
**Technical "Flex":**
- **Algorithm:** Uses a "Knapsack-style" optimization algorithm with **Heuristic Pruning**. It pre-sorts items by "efficiency" (calories/price) and stops recursion after finding the top 6 combos to prevent UI freezes.
- **Architecture:** Client-side only (Serverless). Logic runs entirely in the browser using static TypeScript data.
- **Constraint System:** Implements a "Compatibility Matrix" to prevent culinary clashes (e.g., prevents suggesting Rice + Pasta together).

### PROJECT_4: JobFit - AI Resume Analyzer
**Type:** Solo Project.
**Summary:** An agentic AI pipeline that screens resumes against job descriptions.
**Technical "Flex":**
- **Architecture:** Uses **LangGraph** to model the analysis as a State Machine (Extraction -> Analysis -> Profiling -> Compatibility).
- **Security:** Implements "Direct-to-S3" uploads using AWS Presigned URLs to bypass server bottlenecks.
- **Handling Hallucinations:** Uses Regex-based JSON extraction (`safe_parse_json`) to clean LLM outputs before rendering.
- **Scoring:** Uses a Generative Scoring Engine (LLM as Judge) rather than simple vector similarity.

### PROJECT_5: LexiBot - AI Legal Assistant
**Type:** Solo Project (Patent Applied).
**Summary:** A Telegram chatbot for Indian legal queries (RAG-based).
**Technical "Flex":**
- **Intelligent Chunking:** Does NOT use fixed-size chunks. Uses an LLM + Regex to split documents at semantic boundaries (Articles, Sections) to preserve legal context.
- **Infrastructure:** Runs Qdrant (Vector DB) in Docker. Uses a `healthcheck` in Docker Compose to ensure the DB is ready before the bot starts.
- **Memory:** Uses `ConversationBufferWindowMemory` (k=5) to handle follow-up questions ("What is the penalty for *that*?").

### PROJECT_6: F&B Process Anomaly Detection
**Type:** Solo Project.
**Summary:** Industrial ML pipeline to detect defects in food batches.
**Technical "Flex":**
- **Ensemble Model:** Combines 4 algorithms (Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, LOF, Autoencoder). A batch is flagged only if ≥2 models agree (Consensus Voting).
- **Explainability:** Uses **SHAP** (Shapley Additive Explanations) to tell operators exactly *which* sensor (e.g., "Humidity") caused the alarm.
- **Auto-Thresholding:** The Autoencoder dynamically sets its error threshold based on the 95th percentile of reconstruction error, adapting to new data automatically.

### PROJECT_7: Better LinkedIn (Frontend Architecture)
**Type:** Solo Project.
**Summary:** A clean, high-performance redesign of LinkedIn.
**Technical "Flex":**
- **Performance:** Uses `react-window` for list virtualization (rendering only visible posts) to handle infinite feeds without lag.
- **Custom Hooks:** Built `useStickySidebar` to mathematically calculate sticky positioning when CSS `position: sticky` fails in complex layouts.

### PATENTS_DETAILED

[PATENT_1]
Title: AI-Assisted Terms & Conditions Summarization and Real-Time Compliance Guidance System.
Innovation: A "Real-Time Guidance Layer" (Browser Extension) that warns users *before* they violate a Terms of Service clause (e.g., "Stop! Mass downloading is banned"). Uses an "Action-Clause Mapper" to link UI events to legal text.

[PATENT_2]
Title: LexiBot: AI-Powered Legal Assistant.
Innovation: A "Dynamic Legal Knowledge Graph" specifically for Indian Law. Unlike static bots, it models relationships between statutes (amendments, contradictions) and uses semantic caching to answer repeated queries instantly.

[PATENT_3]
Title: MealMatch AI.
Innovation: A "Multi-Constraint Filtering Engine" that solves the "Health vs. Wealth" problem by filtering menus for *both* Calorie Limits and Budget Ceilings simultaneously.
